# Optimizing NimbusNote Pro for Large Teams

For teams with more than 200 active members, you should:

- Prefer Pro or Enterprise plans for 365-day version history.
- Use desktop apps for heavy editing; they sync every 10 seconds while active.
- Avoid having thousands of tags; use notebooks and spaces instead for better search performance.
