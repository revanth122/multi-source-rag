# Sync & Backup

NimbusNote Pro syncs notes every 10 seconds while you are actively editing.

## Backup policy
We keep:
- 30 days of version history on the Basic plan
- 365 days of version history on the Pro and Enterprise plans

Backups are stored in encrypted form in our primary cloud region (us-central).

If sync is paused manually, no cloud backup is created until sync resumes.
