# NimbusNote Pro – Getting Started

NimbusNote Pro is a cloud-based note-taking and collaboration tool.

## Creating a workspace
Every user starts with a personal workspace. Team workspaces can be created by admins only.

## Sync behavior
Notes are synced to the cloud whenever the device is online. If a conflict occurs, NimbusNote creates a "conflict copy" and does not delete user data automatically.

## Offline mode
On desktop and mobile, notes edited offline are stored locally and synced automatically once the device reconnects.
